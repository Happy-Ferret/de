In case of ODT, this is the @html2odt@ gem, which in turn is based on \"xhtml2odt\":https://github.com/abompard/xhtml2odt, which uses XSLT to transform HTML to OpenDocument compatible XML. \r\n\r\nThe Redmine integration mainly consists of code to handle image paths and a bit of clean up before passing the HTML to the library.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThis change was implemented for a Planio customer, who wanted to use the Wiki to create simple templates, that users should then fill out using MS Word (and friends). We chose to export ODT (instead of DOCX e.g.) since the OpenDocument format is an open standard, the tool support was better and since it is supported by a wide range of word processing applications (MS Word 2010 and later, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, AbiWord, Pages).\r\n\r\nPlease note, that this feature benefits from the change proposed in #22898.
